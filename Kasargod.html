          <h3><b><center>BEKAL FORT</h3></b></center>
          <p>Around 16 km to the south of northernmost district in Kerala, Kasaragod, lies the massive Bekal Fort. It is among the biggest forts in Kerala and has been impeccably maintained throughout the years. It rises to 130 feet above sea level and is situated on a headland spanning 35km. Much effort has been put to develop a beautiful beach here called the Bekal Fort Beach. People flock to these spots in great numbers. Situated comfortably on steep hills by the sea, the fort provides for an imposing view from the beach. Built using laterite slabs and with a polygonal shape, it is amongst the most visited sites in Kerala.

            There are many factors that have added to the popularity of the site. An observation tower fitted with beautiful peepholes, the Anjaneya Temple with its famous masonry and two Theyyam sculptures built from laterite are among the primary attractions. An ancient mosque built by Tipu Sultan and various underground passageways are also important places in the area. A rock garden was built using laterite in the parking area and is an architectural marvel in itself. Trees have been planted on the beach along with the construction of a splendid walkway which makes it easier to traverse the beach and enjoy its sights. At night, the entire place is lit up with special lights that add a whole new dimension to its beauty.

          <h3><b><center>VALIYAPARAMBA</h3></b></center>
          <p>The scenic backwater near the Bekal Fort transports us to a serene environment away from the hustle and bustle. The mesmerizing view from a kettuvallam (houseboat) is probably the one thing that you need to just lay back and relax. Valiyaparamba is the third-largest backwaters in Kerala which provides a picturesque view of the local flora and fauna.

            The boat ride through the backwaters takes you to Valiyaparamba island, the largest island in Kavvayi backwaters. One can relax in the houseboat and enjoy the rustic charm of the unspoiled backwaters, catch fish or enjoy a nice meal in the houseboat. The calm and secluded Valiyaparamba Island is a perfect getaway from the city.
            
            The Valiyaparamba beach is not very far away and remains untouched by tourists. Although Valiyaparamba backwaters is a favourable spot all throughout the year, November to May is the best time and it will help you escape the summer.
